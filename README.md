# esclang

An experiment in creating a new programming language.

## Repository

The source code for the compiler is a C# project in the `src/esc-cs` tree. 

The resulting executable then can compile `.esc` files in the `src/esc` tree. 

The output from this compilation is saved to the `src/esc-out` tree.
